# Cage Bar Website

## About This Project

This is a client-commissioned website developed for a local bar to enhance their digital presence and drive customer engagement. Working directly with the business owner, I created a modern, responsive web application that makes essential bar information easily accessible and promotes upcoming events to attract more customers.

## Business Objectives & Client Collaboration

The primary goal was to solve real business challenges: customers struggled to find current hours, event information, and bar details. 

Through collaborative sessions with the client, I identified key user needs and designed a solution that streamlines information discovery while showcasing the bar's atmosphere and upcoming events. This direct client work experience involved:

- Gathering requirements through stakeholder meetings
- Presenting design concepts and wireframes  
- Iterating based on client feedback
- Delivering a solution that meets business objectives

## Technical Implementation

The site is built with a focus on **performance**, **accessibility**, and **maintainable code structure**. 

I implemented responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience across all device types, utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox for sophisticated layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

---

## Development Approach

Throughout development, I maintained clean, semantic HTML structure while implementing modern CSS techniques for styling and animations. 

The codebase follows industry best practices including:
- Organized file structure
- Consistent naming conventions  
- Modular component design that promotes code reusability
- Maintainable architecture

---

## Performance & Deployment

The site was deployed with **integrated speed insights monitoring** to track real-world performance metrics. 

I plan to continuously optimize based on these analytics, ensuring the site maintains fast load times that directly impact customer experience and search rankings. This data-driven approach to performance optimization demonstrates commitment to measurable business outcomes.
